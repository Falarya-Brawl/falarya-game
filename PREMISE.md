# Falarya Brawl Game Premise

Falarya Brawl is ambiented on a medieval fantasy world called Verolania, where the belief in myths and powerful magic still surround the mind of the living beings of the continent.
But due to the reign of an autocratic monarchy, the people of Verolania live in a crescent state of poor and disease. This state of necessity constantly leads brave figures to become adventurers and seek treasures that could change their lives for good.
And what better place to find sacred treasures than the lost civilization of Falarya, the lair of the ancient(and rich!) mythic elves, well, that is what runs through the mind of the bravest adventurers of those lands, but what they really don't know, is what await they on the MAGIC, INCREDIBLE AND DEADLY REIGN OF FALARYA!
